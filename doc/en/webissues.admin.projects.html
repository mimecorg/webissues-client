The relevant commands are available if you activate the project tree by clicking on it. In case of the Web Client, select the <span class="guilabel">Manage Projects</span> command, located above the projects tree, to manage projects and folders.</p>
          <p>If you are a system administrator, you can manage all projects and create new projects. If you are the administrator of a project, you can manage its members and folders.</p>
          <p>To add a new project, select <span class="guilabel">Add Project</span>, enter the name and optional description of the project and click <span class="guibutton">OK</span>.</p>

            <p>When deleting projects or folders, pay special attention whether you are not mistakenly deleting the wrong data. All issues contained in them are permanently and irreversibly removed from the system, and it's not possible to restore them. You can archive a project instead of deleting it to make it possible to restore it later if necessary.</p>

          <p>The project description is displayed when the project is selected in the projects tree in both the Web Client and the Desktop Client. It can be used to provide information about the project, including links to important issues or external resources. Both system administrators and project administrators can add a description to an existing project, edit the description and delete it. Project descriptions use the same format as issue descriptions and comments; see <a class="xref" href="webissues.work.issues.html#webissues.work.issues.comments" title="Comments and descriptions">the section called “Comments and descriptions”</a> for more information.</p>

            <p>You can also move a folder from one project to another. In order to do this, you must be the administrator of the system or of both projects — the source one and destination one.

                  <p>Public projects are visible to all users in the system, including both system administrators and regular users. There is no need to explicitly grant access to individual members, except for project administrators. This is useful for projects containing common data, such as discussion boards, and also when it's not necessary to restrict user permissions for individual projects. Also, when anonymous access is enabled, the project can be accessed in read only mode without logging in to the system.</p>

            <p>When a project is no longer needed, it is possible to remove it without permanently deleting it. When a project is archived, it is removed from the projects tree and no one can access any folders and issues in that project. However, unlike deleted projects, archived projects can be restored at any time. Only system administrators can archive and restore projects.</p>
            <p>To archive a project, go to <span class="guilabel">Manage Projects</span> from the main window, select the project, and then click <span class="guilabel">Archive Project</span>. In case of the Desktop Client, this command is available directly from the main window if you activate the projects tree.</p>
            <div class="tip">
              <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
              <p>It is not possible to archive individual folders, but you can create a new project, move the folder or folders that you want to archive to that project, and then archive the project.</p>
            </div>
            <p>To open a list of archived projects, go to the Administration Panel and click <span class="guilabel">Projects Archive</span>. This function is not available in the Desktop Client.</p>
            <p>To restore an archived project, select the project and click <span class="guilabel">Restore Project</span>. The project will be removed from the list of archived projects and will appear in the projects tree. The folders, issues, permissions, alerts and other information related to the project will be preserved.</p>
            <p>To permanently delete an archived project, select the project and click <span class="guilabel">Delete Project</span>. In that case it will no longer be possible to restore any information associated with the project. You can also use the <span class="guilabel">Rename Project</span> command to rename an archived project and the <span class="guilabel">View Description</span> command to view the description of the project, if available. Note that it is not possible to access any folders and issues or to modify the project while it's archived.</p>
