          <p>The Desktop Client allows you to create simple reports containing a list of issues or details of the selected issue. These reports can be directly printed or saved as a PDF or HTML document. You can also export the list of issues to a CSV file, which can be imported into a spreadsheet or an external database.</p>
          <p>To create a report based on a list issues, open the folder, and select the view if you want to filter the issues. Make sure that the list of issues is active by clicking on it, and then select the <span class="guibutton">Print</span> command to print the report, or <span class="guibutton">Export</span> to save it in PDF format. To export the list as a document in HTML format or as a CSV file, expand the menu next to the <span class="guibutton">Export</span> button and select the appropriate option.</p>

            <div class="figure-title">Figure 3.23. Printing a list of issues</div>
          </div>
          <p>The report can be a simple table, which can contain only columns which are visible in the selected view, or all system columns and user-defined columns (attributes). The report may also have the form of a summary, including the properties and attributes of individual issues. When exporting to CSV format it is only possible create a table report.</p>

When printing a report, press <span class="guibutton">OK</span> and then select the printer and possibly other printing options.

          <div class="figure">

            <p>Depending on the regional settings, Excel can sometimes incorrectly read the CSV file, so that all fields are displayed in one column, or misinterpret the character encoding. In this case, use the function of importing a text file, select the UTF-8 encoding and choose comma as the column separator. The same applies to other applications which import CSV files.</p>

          <p>The report can be a summary that displays only the properties and attributes of the selected issue. It can also be a full report, containing the entire history of the issue. In case of a  full report, the filter chosen in the issue history view is taken into account (for example, only comments or only attachments).</p>
          <p>Similarly to the list of issues, if you are saving the report as a file, select the type of report, press <span class="guibutton">OK</span> and then select the folder where you want to save the file and enter its name.
