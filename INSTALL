Requirements
============

 * Qt framework, version 5 (http://www.qt.io/)

 * SQLite (http://www.sqlite.org/)

 * Optional: OpenSLL toolkit (http://www.openssl.org/)

The program can be built using the standard 'qmake' tool from Qt. Simple configure
scripts are available for both Linux and Windows which create a configuration file
and run qmake with appropriate parameters. See detailed instructions below.

WebIssues requires SQLite compiled as a shared library and Qt compiled with
the '-system-sqlite' option. The configuration of Qt which includes a statically
linked version of SQLite will not work.

In order to support secure connections over HTTPS, Qt must be built with OpenSSL
support enabled.


Linux
=====

To compile the program you will need a C++ compiler (preferably gcc) and headers
for the Qt library (if you use binary packages, make sure you have the appropriate
'devel' package installed).

The typical procedure of building and installing the program is:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    # make install

Additional options that can be passed to the configure script:

    -prefix DIR

        Location where the package will be installed (default is '/usr/local').

    -qmake PATH

        Full path to the 'qmake' tool (required if it cannot be found
        automatically).

    -debug

        Build with debugging symbols.


Windows
=======

You must have the open source edition of Qt installed. The program can be compiled
using either the MinGW compiler or Microsoft Visual C++.

If you are using MinGW, open the Qt Command Prompt. Go to the directory where
you have unpacked WebIssues and run:

    > configure.bat
    > mingw32-make

If you are using Microsoft Visual C++, open the Visual Studio Command Prompt.
Make sure that QTDIR is set to the path where Qt was installed. Go to the directory
where you have unpacked WebIssues and run:

    > set QTDIR=C:\path\to\qt5
    > configure.bat
    > nmake

Additional options that can be passed to the configure script:

    -prefix DIR

        The location where the package will be installed (default is
        'C:\Program Files\WebIssues').

    -debug

        Build with debugging symbols.

    -msvc

        Generate a solution for Microsoft Visual Studio instead of Makefiles.

    -I DIRS

        Specify additional directories containing include files.

    -L DIRS

        Specify additional directories containing library files.


Mac OS X
========

To compile the program you will need a C++ compiler and headers for the Qt library.
The typical procedure of building the program is:

    $ ./configure
    $ make

To create the binary package you can run the attached script:

    $ cd packages/osx
    $ ./maintainer-build-package.sh /path/to/qmake

Additional options that can be passed to the configure script:

    -prefix DIR

        Location where the package will be installed (default is '/usr/local').

    -qmake PATH

        Full path to the 'qmake' tool (required if it cannot be found
        automatically).

    -debug

        Build with debugging symbols.

    -universal

        Build for x86_64, x86 and PPC platforms.

    -target VERSION

        Set OS X deployment target (default target is 10.3).

    -sdk PATH

        Set OS X SDK (default is /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk).
